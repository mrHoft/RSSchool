## Presentation Assignment (100 points)

Achieve a full score by fulfilling all the steps outlined below:

1. **Presentation Creation**: Utilize _Reveal_ for your slides, ensuring both slides and speech transcript are in English.
2. **Speech Recording**: English recording is mandatory, with two acceptable methods:
   - **Camera Option**: Record using any camera device ðŸ“·, ensuring both your face and slides are visible. [Here's a great example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JezLAu4751Y&feature=youtu.be).
   - **Software Option**: Use [OBS](https://obsproject.com/) or similar software for recording, with requirements matching the camera option.
3. **Video Upload**: Post your recorded presentation to YouTube, setting it to _unlisted_ if privacy is a concern, and link your slides in the video description.
4. **Documentation**: On your private school repository, create a `presentation` branch and a markdown file `presentation.md` containing:
   - YouTube video link;
   - Link to your Reveal slide deck;
   - (Optional) Presentation transcript link;
   - (Optional) Additional comments.
5. **Pull Request**: Submit your work via a Pull Request titled `presentation`, awaiting review without merging.

**Note**: Failure to use Reveal or reading off the presentation results in a score of **0 points**.
