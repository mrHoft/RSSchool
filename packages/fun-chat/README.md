What could be better than chatting with your friends using a chat app?<br>
But what if the service owner deletes your messages? Or, on the contrary, they can store your chat history without your consent!<br>
You know how to create an outstanding design and functionality, right? Let's not delay and get down to work! Let's create our own chat.

### Features:

- [MVP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller) design pattern.
- [Feature-Sliced Design](https://feature-sliced.design/) architecture.
- Custom Router (adapted to pages).
- Custom Storage utility class.
- Theme switcher.
- Custom EventBus and Reactive Component classes.
- Modal and popup message components.
- Markdown parser
- Ability to send messages with different format and content

## Functional Requirements

#### 1. User Authentication Page (+30)

- (+10) The authentication form validates the entered data based on at least two different criteria.
- (+5) The user is unable to submit an authentication request with data that has not passed validation.
- (+5) In case of an authentication error (based on the server response), a message indicating the corresponding error sent by the server must be displayed.
- (+5) User authentication is possible both by clicking the button with the mouse or by pressing the "Enter" key without the need to focus on the button.
- (+5) Access is granted only to not authenticated users.

#### 2. Main Page (+10)

- (+10) Access is granted only to authenticated users.

#### 3. Header (on the main page) (+10)

- (+3) Displays the current authenticated user's name.
- (+2) Displays the app's name.
- (+5) Includes a logout button which when pressed terminates the current session and opens the authentication form (window/page).

#### 4. Footer (on the main page) (+5)

- (+5) Includes the school's logo and name, the author's name, a link to the author's GitHub, and the year of the app creation.

#### 5. User List (on the main page) (+30)

- (+10) Displays all registered users and an indicator of each user's online status.
- (+5) The currently authenticated user is not in the list.
- (+5) Implements user search by name.
- (+10) Displays information about the number of unread messages from each user.

#### 6. User Dialogue (on the main page) (+75)

- (+5) Provides information about the user with whom the dialogue is open, as well as indicating whether that user is online.
- (+5) Provides a complete message history with the selected user, including messages from both the current user and the user with whom the dialogue is currently open.
- (+5) Arranges messages chronologically based on the time of sending. The latest message is displayed near the message input and send component.
- (+5) In the absence of message history, a message in the message history field indicates that this is the beginning of the dialogue.
- (+5) When sending a message to another user, the message history scrolls to the sent message (making the just-sent message visible to the user).
- (+5) When receiving a message from another user in an open dialogue, the message history scrolls to the received message (making the just-received message visible to the user).
- (+5) When opening a dialogue with unread messages, new messages are separated from the read messages by a dividing line, and the user can see the dividing line and at least one unread message.
- (+5) When new unread messages appear (before meeting the conditions to remove the dividing line), the line must always stay within the dialogue area and not hide in the scroll area.
- (+5) The dividing line between read and unread messages can be removed by each of the following actions: when scrolling the message history area, after clicking the message send button, or clicking inside the message history area.
- (+5) If no recipient is selected, the message send button and message input field must be inactive (or hidden), and there must be a message in the message history field indicating the need to select a recipient.
- (+5) Sending a message to a user is possible both by clicking the send button with the mouse or by pressing the "Enter" key without the need to focus on the send button.

- (+10) The user can delete their own previously sent messages.
- (+10) The user can edit the text of their own previously sent messages.

#### 7. Message Content (on the main page) (+25)

- (+10) Messages include the time of sending, sender's username, message delivery status, message text
- (+5) Indication of whether the message has been edited.
- (+5) The message "delivered"/"read" status is visible only to the sender of the message.
- (+5) A user cannot send a message without any content (without text).

#### 8. Message Delivery and Read Status (on the main page) (+20)

- (+10) The status changes to "delivered" when the message recipient logs into the application or if the message is sent to the user who is online.
- (+10) The status changes to "read" when the message recipient opens a dialogue with unread messages and performs any of the following actions: scrolls in the message history area, sends a new message, or clicks inside the message history area.

#### 9. About Page (+10)

- (+5) Contains brief information about the application and its author. The content is at the student's discretion.
- (+5) Access is granted to all users.

#### 10. Interface and Visual Design (+15)

- (+5) The browser tab must display the application icon.
- (+5) The interface elements with which the user will interact must be responsive and the cursor must change when they are hovered over.
- (+5) Responsive layout must be implemented for resolutions ranging from 1440 px to 380 px, inclusive.

#### 11. Server Connection (on all pages) (+20)

- (+10) If a sudden disconnection from the server occurs, a message must be displayed to the user, and an attempt to restore the connection must be made.
- (+10) Upon reconnecting to the server, the application must perform the current user reauthorization without requiring user intervention.

## Technical Requirements (+160)

- (+20) All HTML content is generated using JavaScript. `Body` must be empty.
- (+20) The application is a Single Page Application (SPA) with implemented routing.
- (+20) Input/output parameters of all methods are explicitly typed, and the `any` type is not used.
- (+20) ESLint with the Airbnb style guide is used, with the `noInlineConfig: true` rule enabled in the configuration.
- (+10) Prettier is used to automatically format code, ensuring a consistent and readable code style.
- (+10) Husky is used to manage Git hooks, automating tasks such as code formatting and linting checks during the commit process.
- (+10) Webpack or another module bundler is used.
- (+10) Code is organized into small functions with clear names and purposes, with each function not exceeding 40 lines.
